# MiniPaint

## What did I learn?
MiniPaint uses a class called MyCanvas ([https://github.com/t-benedek/MiniPaint/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/minipaint/MyCanvasView.kt])
to implement a simple 2D paiting mini app. You can draw lines with touching the display with your finger. 

## Known issues
It was not possible to remove the header with the application name so that the whole display can be used for drawing.
